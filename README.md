# Analyzing Symptoms for Early Diabetes Detection

## Authors: Angela Cheng, Crystal Diaz, Janet Pham, Laurand Osmeni

## Introduction
_Why was the project undertaken?_

This project was undertaken because our team believed it is a matter that requires immediate attention to data science and visualization techniques to improve diabetes detection and prediction. The practice with analytical methods and visualizing predictions was to empower healthcare professionals with valuable insights, enabling timely interventions and more effective management of the disease. Also, making an impact on the advancement of medical practices would help to improve outcomes for individuals affected by diabetes.Furthermore, according to CDC, more than 37 million people in the US have diabetes and about 1 in 5 of them do not have diabetes. Within is 96 million US adults, over a third-have prediabetes, and more than 8 in 10 of them don't know they have it. Diabetes is also the eighth leading cause of death in the US. 

_What was the research question, the tested hypothesis or the purpose of the research?_
We hypothesized that

## Selection of Data
_What is the source of the dataset? Characteristics of data?_
Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00529/diabetes_data_upload.csv

Dataset Description: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Early+stage+diabetes+risk+prediction+dataset.

Characteristics of data: 
The dataset consists of 520 instances representing newly diagnosed diabetic individuals. There are 17 attributes describing signs and symptoms related to diabetes. The dataset is specifically designed for early stage diabetes risk prediction. Is obtained from the UCI website, which is a reliable and respected source for machine learning datasets. However, our team is unable to independently verify the accuracy of the dataset and its attribute information. 

_Any munging or feature engineering?_
Yes, to prepare the dataset for analysis, we performed data cleaning and feature engineering. This involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, and fixing inconsistencies. We also created new features and transformed existing ones to better capture relevant information. These steps improved the quality and usefulness of the data for our analysis.

## Methods
_What materials/APIs/tools were used or who was included in answering the research question?_
Methods and materials we used for data analysis libraries were Pandas and NumPy, along with machine learning libraries as scikit-learn, for building and training predictive models. Visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn were used to present the findings and visualize the data.

Collaborative platforms such as Slack, GitHub, Colab, and Jupyter Notebook were employed to facilitate communication among team members and share code. Everyone on the team participated in answering the research question, providing input, suggestions, and making improvements to the project.

Also, we searched and looked at the valuable insights from healthcare professionals through the clinician professional website, https://diabetes.org. Their expertise helped us gain domain specific knowledge on aspects related to diabetes detection and management.

## Results
_What answer was found to the research question; what did the study find? Was the tested hypothesis true? Any visualizations?_

## Discussion
_What might the answer imply and why does it matter? How does it fit in with what other researchers have found? What are the perspectives for future research? Survey about the tools investigated for this assignment._
